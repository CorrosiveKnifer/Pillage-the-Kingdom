[7:30am - 10:14am]
	- Altered the tile.ini file to take in the additional tiles created by Jack.
	- Allowed tiles to be drafted sprites within an the .ini file.
	- [Bug 002 - BackBuffer?]
		- Rotated tiles aren't lining up 100% correctly.
		- Causing a black line and jagged tracks being displayed.
		- Thought:
			- Either the sprites aren't exactly rotatable or there is a piviot issue with the backbuffer.
		- [Temp Fix]
			- If the sprite is rotated, then the x & y coordinates are minused 1.
	- Added functionality to request nextTarget for a moving troop.
	- Added comment suggestions to Dominic's code for alterations which would suit the map's code (e.g. setting targetting).
