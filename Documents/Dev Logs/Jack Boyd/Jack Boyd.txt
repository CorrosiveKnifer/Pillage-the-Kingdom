	-Started adding in a normal troop to the game, to test how to make the movement work
	-Will come back and finish testing tonight

9:00pm - 11:00pm
	-Finished Testing the normal troop drawing onto screen
		This included drawing a normal troop onto the screen, and using the arrows to control which direction
		the troop is facing (which is being done by changing the y value the sprite is drawn from) COMPLETE SUCCESS
	-Set up a finished AnimatedSprite class that allows the x and y frame positions to be manipulated
	-Altered size of game to 1920x1080
	-Made all tile sprites (horizontal, vertical, L and J shaped tiles)
	
Tuesday 17th October
11:30am - 2:00pm
	-Designed Wooden Tower (Sprite)
	-Designed Rock Projectile (Sprite)
		Tested drawing both wooden tower and projectile sprites COMPLETE SUCCESS
	-Edited Bug in AnimatedSprite Class
		The bug was that the frame rate would stay the same, even if the user would change it with the setframespeed method
		This was because of a while loop that wasn't actually checking the speed, but a constant value i had put in when i started making the class
		just so that i could actually get the sprites onto the screen. FIXED
