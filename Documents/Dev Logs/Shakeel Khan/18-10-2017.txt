Projectiles now lerp correctly to enemy troops. 
Collision detection between projectile and troop also working, uses a circle based detection. 
Have yet to implement destroying the projectile after collision. 

Added a get/set health to the troop to help debug the tower collision. 

The circle collision detection is in entity's "is colliding with" method, so all entities should have this collision detection logic.
